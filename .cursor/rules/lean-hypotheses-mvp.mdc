      When defining an MVP, use Lean Hypotheses to focus your team and validate assumptions:

      1. **Formulate a Lean Hypothesis:**
         ```
         We believe [TYPE OF USER] has a problem [DOING THING].
         We can help them with [OUR SOLUTION].
         We'll know we're right if [CHANGE IN METRIC].
         ```

      2. **Define the MVP:**  
         - The MVP is the smallest experiment or feature that can in/validate your hypothesis.
         - Avoid building full solutions up front; test the core assumption with minimal effort.

      3. **Iterate Based on Results:**  
         - If the metric changes as expected, iterate or expand.
         - If not, revise your hypothesis and MVP.

      **Benefits:**
      - Keeps teams focused on real user problems
      - Reduces wasted effort on unproven features
      - Enables rapid learning and iteration

      **Example:**
      ```
      Hypothesis:
      We believe SHOPPERS have a problem CHOOSING FROM THE MASSIVE SELECTION OF PORK PRODUCTS.
      We can help them by SHOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER SHOPPERS.
      We'll know we're right if SHOPPERS ADD ITEMS TO CART MORE QUICKLY.

      MVP:
      Add a "Recommended Products" section curated by staff (no recommendation engine needed).
      ```

      If the MVP succeeds, iterate (e.g., segment recommendations by geography). If not, try a new hypothesis.
