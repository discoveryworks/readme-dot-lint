### 1. survey a bunch of README structures. What are the common H2s?

e.g.

- Synopsis
- Quickstart
- Contributing
- License
- Contact info 
- Audience
- Vision/Mission/Purpose (Statement of Value)
- repo-specific h2s

### 2. Standardize a Statement of Value for each repo

A few short lines that address:

- WHAT is this? (what're we asserting as the Problem? What's the Solution? What positive change does this bring to the world?)

- WHY does it exist?
- WHAT is (was?) the problem?
- WHEN was this problem identified and solution proposed/implemented?
  - e.g. ..."once the IBC was adopted, then we had this problem..."
- HOW does this product solve the problem?
- WHO uses it?

- [ ] HMW do this in a ~one-liner. Does a Lean Hypothesis make sense as a standard?
      - We believe USER
      - has a problem with PROBLEM
      - and we can solve it with SOLUTION
      - and we'll know we're right if KPI_CHANGE


### 3. Propose a standard template
   - assert this as a standard
      - [x] explain what the standard is and why it's useful: "convention over configuration"
   - [x] create an embedabble badge
   - link to ICF asking us to make it easier to onboard onto projects
### 4. Munge READMEs to conform to template
   1. ONLY add headers and reorder. No edits!

### 5. Submit PRs amending READMEs to conform to template

---

## Parking Lot

### the timeline
- every "WHEN" is standardized
- we pull it out and build a `.markwhen` file and publish the viz'n\
- here's a blog post on the history of Cosmos (2018) https://blog.cosmos.network/cosmos-history-inception-to-prelaunch-b05bcb6a4b2b
- do we submodule all the repos? there's probably some strong git-fu there


### problem: there's no canonical place to learn about the history of Cosmos

- what does a Viking Saga of Cosmos authorship tree look like?

### Let's revisit the emoji choice

v4 - emoji exploration
---
# ðŸŒŒ Why does ${REPO_NAME} exist?
# ðŸŒŒ Why have a ${REPO_NAME} repo?


# ðŸŒŒ Why ${REPO_NAME}?
# ðŸŒŒ Whence ${REPO_NAME}?
# ðŸŒŒ Whilst ${REPO_NAME}?

# ðŸŒŒ Why Gaia?
# ðŸŒŒ Why ibc-go?


# ðŸŒŒ Why horcrux?
# ðŸŒŒ Why does horcrux exist?
# ðŸŒŒ Why have a horcrux repo?
# ðŸŒŒ Why use horcrux?
## ðŸŒŒ People use horcrux because they got tired of pagerduty waking them up at night.
# ðŸŒŒ Why use ibc-apps?
## ðŸŒŒ Because abstracting an easily discoverable, navigable, central place for modules and middleware from core ibc-go makes the interblockchain better.
## ðŸŒŒ Because finding the best modules is part of what makes interblockchain the best.
## ðŸŒŒ Because expanding what you can do w/ ibc
## ðŸŒŒ Because the interblockchain has the best damn app store of any chain around.
## ðŸŒŒ Because the ibc developers need an app store.
## ðŸŒŒ Because ibc deserves a package manager. (This registry is a start.)
## ðŸŒŒ Because ibc deserves its own apt-get or homebrew.

## Todo
- TODO: let's workshop "why/because" around a little
- review `ibc-apps` PR comments
- pair on "what would ibc-go look like on README.lint"
- add @womensrights and @crodriguezvega to the README.lint repo
- add commented-out defaults to the template/readme
  - ``` # How
        // ppl usually list topics like installation, contributing, etc
    ``` <- - [ ]review the initial spreadsheet scratchpad for mappings

Early IBC work started in the ibc-go repo. As the repo grew, the need arose to parallelize the work among many teams.

The ibc-apps repo is meant to be an easily discoverable, navigable, central place for modules and middleware.

SHIP THIS: "Why...because"

# ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Who ${BENEFITS FROM THIS REPO}
# ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ What ${EXACTLY DOES THIS DO?}
# ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ How ${DO I USE IT? HOW DOES IT WORK?}
# ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Other


## ibc-go w/ Susannah

## Who is ibc-go for?

- Cosmos SDK chain developers who use IBC,
- Cross-chain Developers who access Cosmos and IBC via Light Clients, smart contracts, relayers, and more.

---

### who - scratchpad
Guests
- Light Client developers who want to connect to the Interchain
  - L1s that aren't on Cosmos and the want a Go Light Client

- App devs working on IBC-enabled cosmwasm contracts or building their own custom middleware
- Relayer operators who're interested in the most-used implementation in production.
- Chain developers who want to use IBC // eg penumbra, anoma, nomic

```

- I like v2 best. It's visually distinctive, the ordering is pretty clear, but it feels a little less didactic than putting numerals in front
- I don't like the word "other", it feels too exclusionary and dismissive. It (literally!) "others" the repo-specific stuff that makes this repo a special snowflake that we love. Maybe call it "More"? or something a little more indicative of abundance?
