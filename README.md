ðŸŒŒ Why
=============================
- We believe that folks trying to understand / contribute to the Cosmos ecosystem
- Have a harder time than they need to bc it can be hard to quickly grok a project
- And we could address that at low cost by creating a template for Cosmos OSS projects to encourage consistency and completeness of product and technical vision, and to better socialize those goals.


ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Who
=============================


ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ What
=============================

In the spirit of [Convention Over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), README.lint is a sane default template for a readme. The hope is that users will be able to more easily ramp up on new repos if they know what to expect in the documentationâ€”and that the template can incline authors towards making explicit a core set of concerns, namely:
- "Why did we see the need to spend time and energy building this?", 
- "Who is this repo for?", 
- "What, exactly, is this thing?"
- "How do I set it up? How do I use it?", and
- Anything else that doesn't fit into the above categories.

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ How
=============================

1. Audit existing repos and, without changing anything other than position, organizing the repos into following sections:

```

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ How
=============================


ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Other
=============================

```
2. submitting PRs to those repos
3. ...one day, maybe try upgrade this into an actual automated linter. For now, humans do the work.

## Badges

In order to 1) spread the word, and 2) imply that this exercise is on par with other efforts to ensure consistancy and standards across software, we made a badge!
