# Audit of READMEs

Let's take safari into what's out there rn.
- [] 1. survey a bunch of README structures. 
- [] 2. What are the common H2s?

## General thoughts
- rm'ing content and leaving only headers is a nice exercise. Does it still make sense? Tell a story? If the answer is "no", we're probably missing something.
- the README's are fairly well-architected, but they've got radically different ideas of who their audience is
  - eg IBC: Policy ppl
  - go-layer: for Devs
  - tendermint: archive of knowledge about a thing
  - IDEA: maybe we should have an Empty Folders translation/code_switch for each, ie each README include `For Devs: this is foo. For policy ppl: this is bar`

## IBC
https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/README.md

- 1st take: this is hot garbage. It's just an index...of what?
- 2nd take: it's not code (why's it in a repo?). So I guess it makes sense that it doesn't look like code repos.

- hypothesis: at the begining of Cosmos Time, engineers used the tools they're comfy with (git, gh) to store everything, even planning docs. Now that the community is bigger, that non-code conversation has migrated elsewhere, and the semantics of having this in gh are a little bit of a head-fake.
  - [ ] idea: put this into a more explicit "not code" repo format, eg [ADR](https://github.com/adr/madr) or the like. Do something like https://github.com/adr/madr/tree/main/docs/decisions
